This is the TouchOSC version of pythagoras. As of 2013-03-23, it contains most of the functionality
of the main version, and can be controlled via the mobile app TouchOSC, which is available on
Android and iOS. Run it as you would the main version:

$ python pythagoras.py <debug> <jack>

and connect via the port numbers and IP addresses in pythagoras.py
